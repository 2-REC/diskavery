## Overview

{{< image src="images/skatalites.webp" alt="Band original members" copyright="Skatalites">}}

[The Skatalites](www.skatalites.com) was one of the first ska band. A superband formed in Jamaica by pioneering musicians and producers that helped develop and spread the genre across Jamaica and the world.

Their sound defined the roots of Jamaican Ska, with its bouncy swing tempo, the jazzy brass and steady, skanking beat.
???"Mostly known for their instrumentals, they also had amazing vocalists."
Primarily ska, their sound later evolved to rocksteady and reggae as the trends in Jamaica changed.

The most famous song of The Skatalites is probably "Guns of navarone" (youtube link?), which reached the British Top 40 in 1967.


## (Brief) Storyline

The <i>Skatalites</i> were formed in 1964 in Kingston, Jamaica by key musicians:
* Doreen Shaffer, the "<i>Queen of Ska</i>" (vocals)
* Tommy McCook (saxo)
* Rolando Alphonso (saxo)
* Lloyd Brevett (upright bass)
* Lloyd Knibb (drums)
* Don Drummond (trombone)
* Jerome "<i>Jah Jerry</i>" Haynes (guitar)
* Jackie Mittoo (keyboard)
* Johnny "<i>Dizzy</i>" Moore (trumpet)
* Lester "<i>Ska</i>" Sterling (saxo)
* Jackie Opel (vocals)

Together they created a musical style that would become <i>Ska</i>.

From 1955, the musicians had already been playing together in various studios and had played on many hit records of the time, as a backing band for many vocalist including <i>Jimmy Cliff</i> and <i>Toots and The Maytals</i>, as well as many other Jamaican musicians.
Notably, they accompanied <i>The Wailers</i> (featuring Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer) on their first single "Simmer Down" (youtube link).

In May 1964, they performed together as the <i>Skatalites</i> for the first time at the Hi-Hat club in Rae Town, Kingston.

They rapidly disbanded in 1965 to pursue their own individual careers.
From 1974 they started playing together again occasionally, bringing new members as others left.
In 1983 most of the original members reunited to reform the band.
To this day, the <i>Skatalites</i> are still playing, still featuring some of their legendary founder members.


## My 2 cents

As stated on their official website: "<i>The Skatalites need no introduction</i>".
Everybody knows about them or has at least heard some of their songs.
Their influence in the musical world is incredible: They invented ska, which later also gave birth to other genres such as reggae, dub, etc.

The first ska CD I bought was their album "<i>Foundation Ska</i>". To me it represents the perfect ska album.
