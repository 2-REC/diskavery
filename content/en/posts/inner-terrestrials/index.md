## Overview

{{< image src="images/live.jpg" caption="Inner Terrestrials live" alt="Inner Terrestrials live" copyright="Inner Terrestrials">}}

<br>
<i>Inner Terrestrials</i> (also referred to as <i>iT!</i>) is a British punk band from South London, England.
Originally formed by Jay Terrestrial (vocals, guitar, whistle) and Fran Webber (bass, vocals), their first gig was in February 1994.

Their music is a stomping and eclectic mix of punk, ska, dub and folk. Lyrics are generally aggressively political.
They are the original pioneers of the dub punk sound.


## My 2 cents

When listening to <i>Inner Terrestrials</i>, it makes me think about how it could sound like if <i>Bad Religion</i> were doing ska.
The singer Jay Terrestrial has a similar voice to Greg Graffin from the legendary punk rock band, and both their music have a similar powerful energy.
Of course this is a very personal thought. I don't mean any disrespect or imply that <i>iT!</i> aren't original, as they clearly do have their own unique sound/style.

In my opinion their best album is "<i>Tales Of Terror</i>", where ska is more present and there is a bigger mix of styles.
The earlier albums are definitely more punk (not that it's a bad thing though!).
